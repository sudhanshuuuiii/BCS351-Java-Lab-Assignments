# Assignment 8: Matrices – Transpose and Row Sums

## 1. Experiment Title
Matrices: Transpose and Row Sums

## 2. Aim
To create two-dimensional arrays, visit them row by row, and build a new matrix from one.

## 3. Software / Tools Required
- Java Development Kit (JDK 27)
- Visual Studio Code
- Windows Operating System

## 4. Theory
A two-dimensional array in Java stores data in rows and columns. It is also called a matrix. Each element is accessed using two indexes: one for the row and one for the column.

Nested loops are used to traverse matrix elements. A transpose exchanges the rows and columns of a matrix. Row sums are calculated by adding all elements in each row.

## 5. Algorithm / Procedure

### Question 1: Create and Print a Matrix
1. Create a 3×4 integer matrix.
2. Initialize a variable value to 1.
3. Use nested loops to fill the matrix with values from 1 to 12, row by row.
4. Use nested loops to print the matrix.

### Question 2: Find the Transpose of a Matrix
1. Create a 3×3 matrix containing values from 1 to 9.
2. Create another 3×3 matrix for the transpose.
3. Use nested loops to exchange rows and columns.
4. Store each element using transpose[j][i] = m[i][j].
5. Print the transposed matrix.

### Question 3: Calculate the Sum of Each Row
1. Create a 3×3 matrix containing values from 1 to 9.
2. Traverse each row using an outer loop.
3. Initialize sum to 0 for each row.
4. Use an inner loop to add all elements of that row.
5. Print the sum of each row.

## 6. Input
- Question 1: A 3×4 matrix filled with values 1 to 12.
- Question 2: A 3×3 matrix with rows 1 2 3, 4 5 6, and 7 8 9.
- Question 3: A 3×3 matrix with rows 1 2 3, 4 5 6, and 7 8 9.

## 7. Output

### Question 1
```text
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
```

### Question 2
```text
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
```

### Question 3
```text
Row 1 sum: 6
Row 2 sum: 15
Row 3 sum: 24
```

## 8. Result
Successfully created and printed two-dimensional arrays, calculated the transpose of a matrix, and found the sum of each row using nested loops.
